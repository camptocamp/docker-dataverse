# Introduction

Roughly inspired from https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-docker ; the
docker-compo was just cleaned up to use pre-generated images, so that nothing
is built, and only data to be persisted are mounted as volumes in the `data/`
subdirectory.

Once launched, the app should be available at:

http://localhost:8080/

Default credentials: `dataverseAdmin` / `admin`.
